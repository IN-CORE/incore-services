      <abstract>This study is part of the American National Election Study (ANES), a time-series collection of national surveys fielded continuously since 1948. The American National Election Studies are designed to present data on Americans' social backgrounds, enduring political predispositions, social and political values, perceptions and evaluations of groups and candidates, opinions on questions of public policy, and participation in political life. The 2004 ANES Time Series study was conducted in two waves, before and after the 2004 presidential election in the United States, and comprises both a pre-election interview and a post-election re-interview. A freshly drawn cross-section of the electorate was taken, yielding 1,212 valid cases. Like its predecessors, the 2004 ANES includes both questions necessary for tracking long-term trends and questions attempting to assess the political moment of this particular year. This study maintains and extends the ANES time-series 'core' by providing data on Americans' basic political beliefs, allegiances, and behaviors that are monitored at every election, irrespective of the nature of the specific campaign or the broader setting, because they are central to the general understanding of politics. Current and study-specific topics were also addressed. Questions covering issues prominent in 2004 referred to job outsourcing, private investment of Social Security funds, and President Bush's tax cut. Americans' views on foreign policy, the war on terrorism, and the Iraq War and its consequences were also assessed. Additional questions were asked on inflation, immigration, gender politics, and gay and lesbian politics. The study also extended the experiment on the measurement of voter turnout that began in 2002. Demographic variables include respondent's age, education level, political affiliation, race/ethnicity, marital status, and family composition.</abstract>

        <weight>Weight variables V040101 (pre) and V040102 (post) are available for use as full-sample weights that are the product of the household non-response adjustment factor, the within-household selection weight, and a post-stratification adjustment factor. These variables represent the same type of weighting first provided in weights created in 1997 for the 1994 and 1996 Time Series studies. This weighting post-stratifies to match the Current Population Study (CPS) estimate of the distribution of age group by education level. Weight variables using this construction are available for Time Series studies 1994-2004. (A corresponding weight is not available for Time Series studies preceding 1994 and has not been used since 2004.)</weight>
